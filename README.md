**Simple ChatBot Using Langgraph** 



This is a simple chatbot equipped with tool calling, persistent memory and human-in-the-loop-interactivity. Giving it also the capability to unwind changes if necessary and explore different outcomes by going back to previous states in graph using the checkpoints.
I have used this project to learn the basics about Langgraph, the entire project is available in Langgraph tutorials in the documentation.
